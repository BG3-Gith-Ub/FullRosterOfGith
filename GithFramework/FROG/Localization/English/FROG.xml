	<content contentuid="h14f312c0gb885g4119g8711gec3fd3b3939d" version="1">Gith had been enslaved by mind flayers for countless generations. Some sages claimed that they were once descended from humans, while others maintained that their original race was in fact unknown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After breaking free from their enslavement, philosophical differences led to bitter internal conflict.</content>

	<content contentuid="h5f5de834g5acbg44aeg9953g28dd3482a7b0" version="1">With a ruthlessness borne from mind flayer enslavement, Githyanki ride the Astral Sea atop red dragons, bringing their silver swords and psionic might to bear against any trace of the illithid menace.</content>

	<content contentuid="hd33af732gae42g45edgb67cg5ff9a826cef6" version="1">Solace in the plane of Limbo is something created, not found. The githzerai are a monastic faction of Gith hidden away in limbo, dwelling in sanctuaries cultivated through sheer willpower. Their psionic gifts are unmatched even by Githyanki, as they dedicate their lives to augmenting their spiritual power.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As children of Zerthimon — the betrayer of Gith — , the Githzerai are the result of an uprising against the Illithid empire, a war they continue to wage to this day. Wary of outsiders, the Githzerai have dedicated themselves to solitude.</content>

The Githyanki are trained from birth as warriors, while the Githzerai hone their minds to a razor’s edge in their fortresses within Limbo. But before there were Githyanki or Githzerai, these creatures were a single race enslaved by the Illithids.</content>
